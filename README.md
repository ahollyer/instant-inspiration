###Project Notes

This is one of my first websites. I'm really excited to expand this thing and go beyond what freeCodeCamp requested for the project. We'll see how it evolves over the next few weeks!

####Strengths:
* Bootstrap is becoming more intuitive. I don't need to use reference materials to do the basics anymore.
* Was able to troubleshoot an issue with the developer tools console! Woohoo (my JS was loading before jQuery, in case you were wondering)

####Things to Improve:
- [x] ~~Add "Share to Twitter" button~~ Done 2/5/17
- [ ] Add "Share to Facebook" button
- [ ] Add flavors (themed layout + quotes):
 - [ ] Tolkien
 - [ ] Video Games
 - [ ] Sci Fi
 - [ ] Zen

I'm always looking to learn new things and meet new people. Feel free to contact me if you want to learn together!
